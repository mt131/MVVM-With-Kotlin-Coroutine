# MVVM With Kotlin Coroutine

This is a simple example of Kotlin Coroutine implementation using MVVM architecture. 

## What you will learn :
1. MVVM Architecture with repository 
2. Kotlin Coroutines
3. Singleton class using Kotlin 
4. Retrofit calls using `suspend`
5. Uses of `switchMap`
6. `Resource<T>` to handle `loading`, `success` and `error` cases
